Integrate pixx.io DAM Digital Asset Management into WordPress. Use files from your pixx.io media pool with WordPress easily and without any detour.

== Installation ==

Just install the plugin from the WordPress plugin directory.

To use the plugin you need an account at [pixx.io](https://www.pixx.io). 

The first time you use pixx.io you will be asked for your pixx.io Mediaspace URL and your login data.

== Usage ==

You can easily import image files into your WordPress library with our plugin. 

If you use Gutenberg or the Classic Editor, you can import the images directly from pixx.io into your media library and use them from there.

Otherwise you can just import the images in the media overview.

When importing into your Wordpress library you can choose the file format. Also, there is a preview to choose from where your image will be imported in JPEG format with a maximum width of 1000px.
